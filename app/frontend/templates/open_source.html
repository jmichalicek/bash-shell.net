        <h2 class="text-white text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Open Source?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Open Source Software has been a major part of my daily life since the mid-90s.  Years before I was familiar with the term Open Source I was running Slackware Linux 2.0, compiling horribly written code with gcc, and hosting toy websites no one visited using Apache on a dialup internet connection (which of course were only available when I was online and had given someone my ip address for that session).  Those free, professional, production quality tools gave me a head start on learning and helped keep my interest long enough to turn it all into a career where I am paid well to do more or less what I'd be doing with much of my free time (and still do with a lot of it) anyway.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Because of what Open Source has done for me (and for many others) I have a strong desire to contribute back and to encourage others to do so.  I have all too infrequently contributed bug fixes and features to projects I use regularly and thanks to my employer <a href="https://mobelux.com/" class="hover:text-orange-500">Mobelux</a> and our client/partner <a href="https://livio.io/" class="hover:text-orange-500">Livio</a> I have been able to release a few projects from work.  I have also released a few of my own projects which others may find useful, although they are still mostly toys for me to learn and I have little desire to have to grow a community of contributors around them.

              A system for logging homebrew fermentation temperatures. It has been used an experiment for learning
              different programming languages and frameworks. Its current codebase is a Go web service
              and a Xamarin.Forms client. The client is not currently open source due to the licenses of a few libraries
              which I hope to replace. This was originally a <a href="https://github.com/jmichalicek/worrywort" class="hover:text-orange-500">Phoenix/Elixir server</a>
              and a <a href="https://github.com/jmichalicek/worrywort-client-react-native" class="hover:text-orange-500">React Native mobile app</a>. After
              a long break due to a second child being born and changes in my language interests, that version was abandoned to start the current codebase.
              Eventually I will also add code for monitoring and reporting temperatures from a
              Raspberry Pi and possibly Arduino.

              Django AllAuth is an alternative authentication framework for Django. Django's built in auth system only covers

              Mobelux and New Custom were under the same ownership and it was chosen to be open sourced for ease of use in
              other Mobelux projects which needed to send Apple push notifications at a time when there were no other clients
              using their newer protocol.

              Wagtail is a CMS or framework for more easily building a CMS on top of Django. I use it for my personal website as well as
              for several projects with my employer <a href="https://mobelux.com" class="hover:text-orange-500">Mobelux</a>. It provides an easy to work with editor UI and what it
              calls a StreamField and blocks, which are more polished versions of things I end up building on a regularly and so saves a lot of
              time and effort.
